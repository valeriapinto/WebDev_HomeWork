Description:
When our restaurant Tru won its first 4-star review, my partners and I thanked the staff with a "staff meal" of caviar, champagne and foie gras. So when the second 4-star review came in, we were stuck for a way to celebrate! We decided to go the other extreme, with a feast of the best bratwurst (a Chicago classic), beer and s'mores. I think we got even more respect for the second meal than we did for the first. It takes nerve for 4-star chefs to serve s'mores! My dear friend Karen reintroduced me to the molten, aromatic pleasures of this childhood treat. Just combine three bite-size ingredients — graham crackers, milk chocolate and marshmallow — and apply heat. Add your own summer camp memories and serve immediately.

Ingredients:
32 miniature graham crackers or 8 regular size graham crackers, broken in 1/2
2 milk chocolate bars, the kind that can be broken into squares
8 marshmallows

Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Lay 1/2 of the graham crackers on a cookie sheet. Top with chocolate pieces to cover. Use kitchen scissors to snip the marshmallows in 1/2 horizontally if using miniature crackers and place 1/2 a marshmallow on top of each graham cracker. If using regular size crackers use a whole marshmallow.
Bake until the marshmallows are puffed and golden brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining graham crackers, pressing down slightly to make a sandwich. Serve immediately, while still warm.
